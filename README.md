# Iterative Optimal Transport for Multimodal Image Registration
This repository includes the implementation of our work **"Iterative Optimal Transport for Multimodal Image Registration"**.

A brief introduction about the files:
* `example_data/`: comprising a CT-SPECT image pair with landmarks;
* `demo.ipynb`: a demo script for evaluating and visualizing the registration performance of the IOT method.
* `IOT.py`: implementation of our proposed IOT method;
* `utilis.py`: containing useful functions for image processing and visualization.
